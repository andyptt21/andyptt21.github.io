# Metabolite Similarity Networks

.pull-left[
- Through RaMP, we are collecting data that describes relationships between metabolites:
  - Shared pathway activity
  - Mutual participation in reactions
  - Chemical structural similarity
  - Associations with disease, etc...

- Using this information, we can build knowledge networks describing the information landscape of the database

# Westfall-Young Fisher's p val adjustment

- Westfall and Young (1993) developed a method for p value
  permutation-based adjustment strategy that modeled interdependence
  in gene expression
```{r,eval=FALSE}
## Calculate true p values & sort
p_val_matrix[,1]<-sort(fishers_with_custom_background(metabs_of_interest,metab_panel))

## Calculate fake p values by sampling from background
for(i in 1:iterations){
    fake_metabs_of_interest<-sample(metab_panel,size=length(metabs_of_interest))
    fake_p_vals<-fishers_with_custom_background(fake_metabs_of_interest,metab_panel)
    pval_matrix<-cbind(pval_matrix,sort(fake_p_vals))
}

## Find percentile of true value among rank family
adjusted_p_vals<-apply(p_val_matrix,by_row,get_percentile(true_column,fake_columns))

	- ~~Predict 95th percentile cutoff of random distribution~~
	- Extract nodes with high percentile true score, filter out those

# Building RaMP 2.0 knowledge graph

- As RaMP expands, the number of relationships that are computed grows
  exponentially
- These relationships (except chemical similarity) are sparse,
  allowing them to be stored as sparse matrices
  - NCATS collaborators have code for computing tanimoto similarity
    and storing sparsely (using a cutoff)
- Individual graphs are precomputed on supercomputer (takes ~ 14 hours)
- Remaining questions:
  - How to fuse networks?
  - Include reactions?
  - Remove pathways?
  - Various combinations will be assessed in the validation framework
- Eventually we will build a lipidomics knowledge graph (potentially post-thesis)

---

# Validation experiments

- Compare Fisher's, K-S, topological approaches with various MetaboSPAN candidate workflows
- Biological
  - Updated Liposarcoma analysis
  - Showing consistently perturbed pathways across independent experiments with similar setup (breast cancer, COVID 19)
	- Show that reproducible pathways are biologically coherent
- Simulated
  - Starting with true list of interest, perturb randomly. Show that
    MetaboSPAN recovers true results at higher noise levels than other
    methods
  - Simulated lists of interest. Show MetaboSPAN is robust to noise in
    both promiscuous and non-promiscuous pathways
