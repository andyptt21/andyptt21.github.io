# Background
--

- Pathway annotations are not available for most metabolites identified in an experiment
--

- There's variability in the number and types of metabolites that can be identified in similar experimental conditions
--

- Lipid annotations are sparse and difficult to consolidate
--

  - Pathway coverage is poor
--

  - Alternate schemes are not harmonized
--

- ORA statistics falsely assume that pathways are independent of each other

---

# Aim 1 

### Expand and improve usability of lipid annotations within RaMP from multiple sources
--

.small[
**Subaim 1a:  Consolidate lipid annotations in RaMP from lipid databases**
]
--

.small[
- LION/Web, SwissLipids, Lipid Maps, LipidPedia, InChIKey
]
--

.small[
**Subaim 1b: Improve usability of known lipid annotations by implementing conventional ORA software
for expanded lipidomic knowledge base.**
]
--

.small[
- Structure, Chemical class, Disease, MeSH term, Biological Function,
Reaction(?), Subcellular location, Biochemical/physical properties 
]
--

.small[
**Subaim1c: Develop methodology for the visualization of coverage of pathways in user-supplied data.**
]
--

.small[
- Generate a network visual for demonstrating high level functional clusters in user analytes
]

---
# Aim 2 

### Develop a novel network-based pathway and annotation enrichment method that integrates multiple sources of metabolite/lipid annotations
--

.small[
**Subaim 2a:  Build a consensus similarity network model from multiple annotation types using sim-
ilarity network fusion algorithms**
]
--

.tiny[
- Need to determine how to quantify and weight similarities between analytes on many ontological levels
- Alternative approaches include simpler (sum edge weights, union of edges) or more complex (Grassmann manifold) strategies
]
--

.small[
**Subaim 2b: Develop methodology for detecting enriched pathways and annotations in the consen-
sus similarity network**
]
--

.tiny[
- Currently using random walks with restarts to identify crosstalkers with seed set (list of DE analytes)
- This is used to build a new subnetwork that can be tested for enrichment of annotations
- Heat diffusion is a potential alternative
]
--

.small[
**Subaim2c: Develop MetaboSPAN: R package/Shiny app for Metabolite Structure, Pathway, and Anno-
tation Network enrichment analysis**
]
