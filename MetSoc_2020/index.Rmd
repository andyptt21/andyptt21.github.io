## Pathway-based integration of multi-omics data reveals lipidomics alterations in mouse models of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
.pull-left[
.small[
- Metabolic dysfuntion is known to play a role in Alzheimer's disease
  - APOE4: transports lipids through bloodstream
  -  ABCA7: membrane transporter that regulates lipid homeostasis
-  Analyzed a bunch of publicly available GWAS, Transcriptomic and Proteomic data sets
-  Used GO analysis to find overlapping processes including Redox and 'Metabolic Processes'
-  Overlaid findings onto KEGG global metabolic network

## Pathway Size Matters: The Influence of Pathway Granularity on Metabolomics Enrichment Analysis

.pull-left[
- KEGG pathways are larger than EcoCyc pathways
- Wanted to quantify the effect that pathway size has on enrichment statistics
- Tested 4 pathways in EcoCyc and KEGG across a range of perturbed metabolites
- (Unsurprisingly) smaller backgrounds lead to more significant results

## Genomic-Metabolomic Associations in Age-Related Macular Degeneration
- Leading cause of blindness in the elderly
- Genetic risk factors have been well-characterized, metabolic risk factors have not
- Fasting blood samples taken from patients in Boston and Portugal
  - Metabolon platform identified 544 endogenous metabolites
  - Illumina Omni express identified 4,795 AMD SNPs
- Found mQTLs in ASPM and LIPC genes, which regulate amino acid and lipid metabolism respectively, across all patients
- Glycerophospholipid pathway is likely a crucial pathway in AMD pathogenesis

## INTER-LABORATORY REPRODUCIBILITY OF A TARGETED LIPIDOMICS PLATFORM FOR ANALYSIS OF HUMAN SERUM AND PLASMA
.pull-left[
- Lack of standardized quality control for lipid identification makes
results difficult to compare between laboratories
- Sent standards to 5 different groups and compared quantifications ]
