I enjoy working at the intersection of chemistry, biology, computer science and statistics to address issues with human health. This interest drove me to pursue a PhD in biomedical informatics at the Ohio State University, where I've become involved in untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics research. I'm also currently employed as a research associate at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences under Axle Informatics.

In 2015 I graduated from the State University of New York at Geneseo with a B.S. in Biochemistry and a minor in Biomathematics. From 2015-2016 I was a Postbaccalaureate Fellow in the lab of [Dr. Michael Ombrello](https://www.niams.nih.gov/labs/ombrello-lab#tab-overview) at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases, looking for ultra-rare genetic variants associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I then joined the lab of [Dr. Ewy Mathe](https://ncats.nih.gov/staff/mathee) at the Ohio State University in the Biomedical Informatics department, where I am working on my PhD in Biomedical Sciences with an emphasis on Biomedical Informatics. The main focus of my work with Dr. Mathe has been developing computational tools and resources for the integrative and network-based biological analysis of metabolomic experimental results. I expect to graduate by early 2021. Our group recently moved to the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, where I now work in the Division of Preclinical Innovation.

I am an early career member of the Metabolomics Association of North America, the Metabolomics Society, and the American Society for Mass Spectrometry. I use the R programming language on an almost daily basis to analyze mass spectromety/metabolomics data, and develop new methodology for pathway analysis of metabolomics or multiomic data.
