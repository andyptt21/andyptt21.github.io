I enjoy working at the intersection of chemistry, biology, computer science and statistics to address issues with human health. This interest drove me to pursue a PhD in biomedical informatics at the Ohio State University, where I became involved in untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics research. I'm currently employed as a bioinformatics scientist through Axle Informatics at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences. I also work part-time as a blogger for [Data Revenue GmbH](https://www.datarevenue.com/en-blog).

In 2015 I graduated from the State University of New York at Geneseo with a B.S. in Biochemistry and a minor in Biomathematics. From 2015-2016 I was a Postbaccalaureate Fellow in the lab of [Dr. Michael Ombrello](https://www.niams.nih.gov/labs/ombrello-lab#tab-overview) at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin diseases, looking for ultra-rare genetic variants associated with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. I then joined the lab of [Dr. Ewy Mathe](https://ncats.nih.gov/staff/mathee) at the Ohio State University in the Biomedical Informatics department, where I completed my doctoral thesis titled "Integrative and Network-Based Approaches for Functional Interpretation of Metabolomic Data", defended in June 2021.In 2020 our group moved to the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, where I now work in the Division of Preclinical Innovation.

I am an early career member of the Metabolomics Association of North America, the Metabolomics Society, and the American Society for Mass Spectrometry. I use the R programming language on an almost daily basis to analyze mass spectromety/metabolomics data, and develop new methodology for pathway analysis of metabolomics or multiomic data.
